### This is a project to enable me to find vaccine easily.  
It is set to find only in Chennai, Tamil Nadu under 18.(Can be altered)  
Announces and mails user if vaccine is found.  
Checks every 5 minutes for vaccine for a duration of 500 mins. So tries 100 times.  
Announces if vaccine is not found too.  
Stops as soon as vaccine is found. Can be reset manually.
